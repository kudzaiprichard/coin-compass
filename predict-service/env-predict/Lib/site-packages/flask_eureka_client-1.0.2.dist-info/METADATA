Flask Eureka Integration

How to
======

Install package using:

```bash
pip install flask-eureka-client
```

And then, in your python project:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_eureka import Eureka

app = Flask(__name__)

# do 

eureka = Eureka(app)
eureka.register_service(name="my-flask-service")

app.run()
```

In addition to this, the Eureka defaul blueprint *eureka_bp* offered by the library must be added to your application:

```python
from flask_eureka.eureka import eureka_bp

app.register_blueprint(eureka_bp)
```

Open your eureka discovery service, and the application will be shown as *my-flask-service*.
